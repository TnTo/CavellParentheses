"(The conclusion may seem obvious; but it already  entails one important consequence. There is no such thing as 'behavior',  to be identified prior to and independently of intentions, beliefs and set-tings. Hence the project of a science of be ha vi or takes on a mysterious and  somewhat outre character. It is not that such a science is impossible; but  there is nothing for it to be but a science of uninterpreted physical move-ment such as B.F. Skinner aspires to. It is no part of my task here to ex-amine Skinner's problems; but it is worth noticing that it is not at all clear  what a scientific experiment could be, if one were a Skinnerian; since the  conception of an experiment is certainly one of intention- and belief-informed behavior. And what would be utterly doomed to failure would  be the project of a science of, say, political behavior, detached from a study  of intentions, beliefs and settings. It is perhaps worth noting that when the  expression 'the behavioral sciences' was given its first influential use in a  Ford Foundation Report of 1953, the term 'behavior' was defined so as  to include what were called 'such subjective behavior as attitudes, beliefs,  expectations. motivations and aspirations' as well as 'overt acts'. But what  the Report's wording seems to imply is that it is cataloguing two distinct  sets of items, available for independent study. If the argument so far is cor-rect, then there is only one set of items.)",MacIntyre

But Wittgenstein is not denying that there is all the difference between what is really an objectively valid proof and one which only appears valid (Compare PI, SS304). Misunderstanding of the use of ""objectively valid"" and of such natural philosophical responses as ""By objective, I mean that it is not just a matter of our reactions, our feelings of conviction, but that these reactions are justified by facts independent of what we say or feel"" can make it seem that what matters is a something which in fact could make no difference at all to us. Compare the idea that pain is like the beetle in the box with the idea that perhaps we have always gone wrong in multiplying 4 by 3. Just as it is what we call pain that makes all the difference between pain-behavior with and pain-behavior without pain, it is what we call a necessity that makes all the difference between objectively valid inference and invalid inference. When Wittgenstein says that a valid inference is one which follows a certain paradigm and whose validity is not dependent on anything else, it is the 'else' which is the point. It is not Page 257 a matter of whether there is or is not really any necessity to infer as we do, but the kind of use ""necessity"" has.)",Diamond

We use a form of expression which suggests a comparison of the lines on the paper with something else: a pattern in our minds. The point of bringing up this example here is that the denial that what we are doing is comparing two things with the multiplicity of a face (BB, p. 165) need not seem to involve the claim that there is really nothing but a jumble. It is easier here to recognize such a denial for what it is: it says that we can speak of a picture-face as having a particular expression when we are making a comparison of it with something else, say, another face, and also when that is not what we are doing; and so the use of a form of words which suggests a comparisonand the fact that we mean what we saydoes not settle what we are doing.)",Diamond

"(If one asks: When must a work, or task, be written, or permanently marked?, one may start thinking what makes a work, or task, memorable. And of course the answer to this alone should not distinguish philosophy from, say, music or poetry or early astronomy or ruler and compass proofs in geometry (or, I wish I knew, what level of logic?). Poetry (some poetry) need not be written; novels must be. It seems to me that a thought I once expressed concerning the development of music relates to this. I said (""Music Discomposed"", pp. 200, 201) that at some point in Beethoven's work you can no longer relate what you hear to a process of improvisation. Here I should like to add the thought that at that point music, such music, must be written. If one may speculate that at such a stage a musical work of art requires parts that are unpredictable from one another (though after the fact, upon analysis, you may say how one is derivable from the other), then one may speculate further that Beethoven's sketches were necessary both because not all ideas are ready for use upon their appearance (because not ready ever in any but their right company), and also because not all are usable in their initial appearance, but must first, as it were, grow outside the womb. What must be sketched must be written. If what is in a sketch book is jotted just for saving, just to await its company, with which it is then juxtaposed as it stands, you may say the juxtaposition, or composition, is that of the lyric. If it is sketched knowing that it must be, and gets in time, transformed in order to take its place, you may say that its juxtaposition, or composition, is essentially stratified and partitioned; that of the drama; the drama of the meta-physical, or of the sonata.

But if that is the way the case is put, then wouldn't we be curious to know why anyone would do such a thing, even to know how he could? And suppose I claim that the real drama of the position is better expressed as follows: The skeptic possesses a conceptual scheme (i.e., our conceptual scheme - what other is lived?), but in the resolve and the intensity of his meditation he discovers that he must relinquish, with moans of delirious terror, the basis of its employment. -Then we might be willing to ask, for example, what it means to ""possess"" a concept, or scheme of concepts, and what accepting and rejecting have to do with he matter.)",Cavell

A main use of the examples about pointing is to show that the difference between them is not determined by a particular feeling which accompanies the pointing - not in what is going on hen and there - but in what happens before and after, the circumstances of the act. The examples for concentrating one's attention are used to illustrate a different emphasis, viz., that there may be many different such characteristic accompanying feelings, some common, some not, but no one of them essential hence none a candidate capable of doing what we hought only a particular feeling could do. No harm, I think, need come from this, but this unmarked shift from ""pointing"" to ""concentrating"" is surprising in view of Wittgenstein's severe caution that we not take ""concentrating on a sensation"" as a private ostensive definition, i.e., as a way of pointing to a sensation.)",Cavell

"(If to what we call something and to what we count as something we add the notion of what we claim something to be, we have gathered together the major modes in which we have invoked the fact of talking, he work of wording the world; and if to the pairs telling and counting, and counting and claiming, and claiming and acclaiming or clamoring, hence proclaiming and announcing, and denouncing and renouncing, and counting and recounting, or recounting and accounting, we add the notions of calling to account or accusing, hence excusing and explaining, and add computing and hence reputing and imputing; what we seem headed for is an idea that what can comprehensibly be said is what is found to be worth saying. This explicitly makes our agreement in judgment, our attunement expressed through criteria, agreement in valuing. So that what can be communicated, say a fact, depends upon agreement in valuing, rather than the other way around. This is what our speech acts come to, or come from. Such an idea arose at the beginning of our consideration of Wittgenstein's notion of a criterion when we had to say that his notion seemed to make statements of fact turn on the same background of necessities and agreements that judgments of value explicitly do. It comes up again in beginning to weigh Austin's findings that epistemological assessments, assessments of our offerings of knowledge, can come from curiosity, from suspicion, or from a demand to know the special reason which makes a question (as to the reality of an object) reasonable. Here I am thinking of the special reason as the thing which makes the question worth asking. The idea of valuing as the other face of asserting will make another appearance in Part Two, in the form of the issue of the philosopher's ""nonclaim context"". But while the idea will be present throughout these pages, it will not be much taken up thematically. I understand this idea to require studies in what I should like to call the aesthetics of speech and in he economics of speech. In the former case we follow the fact that understanding what someone says is a function of understanding the intention expressed in his or her saying it, and then the fact that one's intention is a function of what one wants, to a perspective from which responding to what another says is to be seen as demanding a response to (the other's) desire. When in earlier writing of mine I broach the topic ",Cavell
" of the modern, I am broaching the topic of art as one in which the connection between expression and desire is purified. In the modern neither he producer nor the consumer has anything to go on (history, convention, genre, form, medium, physiognomy, composition . . .) that secures he value or the significance of an object apart from one's wanting the hing to be as it is. The consequent exercise of criticism is not to determine whether the thing is good that way but why you want it that way -or rather, the problem is to show that these questions are always together. A strictness or scrupulousness of artistic desire thus comes to seem a moral and an intellectual imperative. About the latter case (of an economics of speech), I have said a word or two in The Senses of Walden (pp. 87 ft.) where I point to the vocabulary established in the opening chapter of Walden, entitled ""Economy"", as the fundamental vocabulary of the work as a whole, implying that the question of true necessaries, which it shares as its opening theme with Plato's Republic and with Rousseau's Social Contract, is a question about what we have to say as much as it is about what we have to do; and in the way Thoreau means hem, the one because of the other. My version of Thoreau's answer is in effect that he takes it upon his writing to tell all and to say nothing. - If we formulate the idea that valuing underwrites asserting as the idea that interest informs telling or talking generally, then we may say that the degree to which you talk of things, and talk in ways, that hold no interest for you, or listen to what you cannot imagine the talker's caring about, in he way he carries the care, is the degree to which you consign yourself to nonsensicality, stupify yourself. (Of course your lack of interest may be your fault, come from your own commitment to boredom.) I think of this consignment as a form not so much of dementia as of what amentia ought o mean, a form of mindlessness. It does not appear unthinkable that he bulk of an entire culture, call it the public discourse of the culture, he culture thinking aloud about itself, hence believing itself to be talking philosophy, should become ungovernably inane. In such a case you would not say that the Emperor has no clothes; in part because what you really want to say is that there is no Emperor; but in greater part because in neither case would anyone understand you.)",Cavell
"(The foregoing parenthetical remarks were added in 1978, while engaged in a final review of this early material, prompted by my awareness, still little educated, that something like the economics of speech is a mounting topic among theorists of, among other things, literature. See, for example, the Introduction to Marc Shell's The Economy of Literature. I might encourage those as backward or tardy as myself to look at Heidegger's ""The Word of Nietzsche: 'God is Dead' "", which includes (pp. 71 ff.) some paragraphs in response to the question, ""Why is Nietzsche's metaphysics the metaphysics of value?"".)",Cavell

Everyone who can play the game knows, e.g., that in certain circumstances the outfielders' correct throw is o second base; and everyone who can play the game can make that hrow in those circumstances. What would it mean for a player to say, ""I know the correct play was to second base, but I just couldn't bring myself to make it""?. For a player, knowledge is virtue. In willing the end within the arena of a game - to play the game to win - players, one might say, have willed beforehand the means to that end; what the means are is known beforehand, known how to be practiced, how to be executed. (Some people seem so good at life that it is as if they have somehow beforehand willed all the means necessary to living well, unsurprised either by the pains of enmity or by the hard labors of love. Call such people thoroughly virtuous. Like really good players, they make what they do look easy.) What players can and cannot do seem so purely a function of talent and of physical condition, not of will and spiritual condition. - And yet this is not all there is to the matter. We know that some very spiritual things - such as effort, concentration, discipline, pride, courage - are what makes the difference between equally endowed, alented, and trained players, or overcome discrepancies in these physical dimensions. And events which in particular test endurance - e.g., longdistance running - seem the very image of the exercise of will. So until further study perhaps we should rather say: In games there is not the same room for akrasia as there is outside.)",Cavell

Later he locates this longing more fully: ""I stand between two worlds. I am at home in neither, and I suffer in consequence. You artists call me a bourgeois, and the bourgeois try to arrest me. . . . [You] ought to realize that there is a way of being an artist that goes so deep and is so much a matter of origins and destinies that no longing seems o it sweeter and more worth knowing than longing after the bliss of the commonplace."" To the objects of his longing he directs the unvoiced remark: ""It was always you I worked for."" Tonio Kroger's remark is necessarily private from those to whom it is addressed since, as Mann's narrator puts it, "". . . their speech was not his speech"". But I recall also that Tonio Kroger speaks of life - his life, life removed from life - ""as the eternal antinomy of mind and art"", and I ask: Do we take seriously Hume's noting of skeptical doubt as a ""malady which can never radically be cured""?; and do we accept as internal to his philosophy his praise of nature in curing him of his ""philosophical melancholy and delirium"" either ""by relaxing his bent of mind, or by some avocation, and lively impression of my senses"", so that he can follow other philosophers in the practice, or necessary distraction, ""upon leaving their closets"" [i.e., private chambers; studies], of ""[mingling] with the rest of mankind in those exploded opinions""?; and do we think him to be asking sincerely, asking his readers to ask hemselves, whether it follows that ""I must strive against the current of nature, which leads me to indolence and pleasure; that I must seclude myself, in some measure, from the commerce and society of men, which is so agreeable; and that I must torture my brain with subtilities and sophistries, at the very time that I cannot satisfy myself concerning the reasonableness of so painful an application . . . ?

It may be that the violation, if survived and expiated, removes the offender from human nature upward, allows his pure spiritualization rather than his pure corporealization, or rather animalization; as presumably in the case, say, of Oedipus; allows the choosing of the other of the two natures of the human, the unique and precarious combination of which creates the problem.)",Cavell
