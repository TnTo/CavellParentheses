For it is in Kant that one finds an explicit recognition that the terms in which the past is criticized are specific to one's own position, and require justification from within that position. A clear instance of such a Kantian term of criticism is his characterization of an opposed ""Idealism"" as making the world ""empirically ideal and transcendentally real""; another is his diagnosis of ""dialectical illusion."")",Must We Mean What We Say?

And that would mean that philosophy, as it has been known, is past.

Whether it also feels to .a given man like the hope of the world depends upon whether that man relocates his sense of worth inside his single skin. That this preposterously simple demand should be so preposterously complex to fulfill is itself maddening. It is simply crazy that there should ever have come into being a world with such a sin in it, in which a man is set apart because of his color-the superficial fact about a human being. Who could want such a world? For an American, fighting for his love of country, that the last hope of earth should from its beginning have swallowed slavery, is an irony so withering, a justice so intimate in its rebuke of pride, as to measure only with God. The question is whether enough men can afford the knowledge that the way the world is comes down in the end to what each son is doing now, sitting within this ordinary walls, making his everyday demands.

"(A test of this would be to consider that the experience of these discoveries-or their proper organ-is as of memory. What precedes certain discoveries is a necessity to return to a work, in fact or in memory, as to unfinished business. And this may be neutral as between re.reading and re-seeing. Then one recalls that one sense of philosophy takes memory as its organ of knowledge. An outstanding question is then: What sends us back to a piece or a passage?-as though it is not finished with us. In the opening pages of Biographia Literaria, Coleridge takes as his first measure of the worth of a poem the fact that we return to it. Knowing that not just any way of returning will constitute such a measure (say, one in order to prepare for tomorrow's lesson, or to look up an illustration for a thing one already knows), he adds that the return is to be made ""with the greatest pleasure."" But he is not there concerned to characterize the nature of this pleasure, nor our need of it. The trouble with speaking of this returning as a remembering is that it provides access to something we haven't first known and then forgotten. Suppose we say that the experience is one of having to remember. Then one thinks of Wordsworth's rehearsal (in Book VIII of the Prelude) of the motive, and resolution, to know of good and evil, ""not as for the mind's delight but for her safety""-the feminine cast registering the mind's need for protection, but the masculine drift showing knowledge that such safety is not achieved through protection, but in action. Evidently Wordsworth is not speaking merely of his past, but of the motive, and resolution, to write-write poetry of such ambitions as the poem he is now writing, and thus give to action the body of the past joined with the soul of the present. And why should the need that sends us back to art be disconnected from the necessity upon which the artist goes for it?)",Must We Mean What We Say?

"(If one asks: When must a work, or task, be written, or permanently marked?, one may start thinking what makes a work, or task, memorable. And of course the answer to this alone should not distinguish philosophy from, say, music or poetry or early astronomy or ruler and compass proofs in geometry (or, I wish I knew, what level of logic?). Poetry (some poetry) need not be written; novels must be. It seems to me that a thought I once expressed concerning the development of music relates to this. I said (""Music Discomposed"", pp. 200, 201) that at some point in Beethoven's work you can no longer relate what you hear to a process of improvisation. Here I should like to add the thought that at that point music, such music, must be written. If one may speculate that at such a stage a musical work of art requires parts that are unpredictable from one another (though after the fact, upon analysis, you may say how one is derivable from the other), then one may speculate further that Beethoven's sketches were necessary both because not all ideas are ready for use upon their appearance (because not ready ever in any but their right company), and also because not all are usable in their initial appearance, but must first, as it were, grow outside the womb. What must be sketched must be written. If what is in a sketch book is jotted just for saving, just to await its company, with which it is then juxtaposed as it stands, you may say the juxtaposition, or composition, is that of the lyric. If it is sketched knowing that it must be, and gets in time, transformed in order to take its place, you may say that its juxtaposition, or composition, is essentially stratified and partitioned; that of the drama; the drama of the meta-physical, or of the sonata.

After Part Two we should in principle be able to ask usefully how the descriptions ""pretends"", ""at the same time"", and ""quietly"" are thought to be justified. Shall we say that they are merely literary, or dramatic, and (hence) dispensable, so that Strawson could as well (i.e., without loss of cognitive content) have said?: The skeptic accepts a conceptual scheme but rejects one of the conditions of its employment. But if that is the way the case is put, then wouldn't we be curious to know why anyone would do such a thing, even to know how he could? And suppose I claim that the real drama of the position is better expressed as follows: The skeptic possesses a conceptual scheme (i.e., our conceptual scheme - what other is lived?), but in the resolve and the intensity of his meditation he discovers that he must relinquish, with moans of delirious terror, the basis of its employment. -Then we might be willing to ask, for example, what it means to ""possess"" a concept, or scheme of concepts, and what accepting and rejecting have to do with he matter.)",The Claim of Reason (1972)

A main use of the examples about pointing is to show that the difference between them is not determined by a particular feeling which accompanies the pointing - not in what is going on hen and there - but in what happens before and after, the circumstances of the act. The examples for concentrating one's attention are used to illustrate a different emphasis, viz., that there may be many different such characteristic accompanying feelings, some common, some not, but no one of them essential hence none a candidate capable of doing what we hought only a particular feeling could do. No harm, I think, need come from this, but this unmarked shift from ""pointing"" to ""concentrating"" is surprising in view of Wittgenstein's severe caution that we not take ""concentrating on a sensation"" as a private ostensive definition, i.e., as a way of pointing to a sensation.)",The Claim of Reason (1972)

"(If to what we call something and to what we count as something we add the notion of what we claim something to be, we have gathered together the major modes in which we have invoked the fact of talking, he work of wording the world; and if to the pairs telling and counting, and counting and claiming, and claiming and acclaiming or clamoring, hence proclaiming and announcing, and denouncing and renouncing, and counting and recounting, or recounting and accounting, we add the notions of calling to account or accusing, hence excusing and explaining, and add computing and hence reputing and imputing; what we seem headed for is an idea that what can comprehensibly be said is what is found to be worth saying. This explicitly makes our agreement in judgment, our attunement expressed through criteria, agreement in valuing. So that what can be communicated, say a fact, depends upon agreement in valuing, rather than the other way around. This is what our speech acts come to, or come from. Such an idea arose at the beginning of our consideration of Wittgenstein's notion of a criterion when we had to say that his notion seemed to make statements of fact turn on the same background of necessities and agreements that judgments of value explicitly do. It comes up again in beginning to weigh Austin's findings that epistemological assessments, assessments of our offerings of knowledge, can come from curiosity, from suspicion, or from a demand to know the special reason which makes a question (as to the reality of an object) reasonable. Here I am thinking of the special reason as the thing which makes the question worth asking. The idea of valuing as the other face of asserting will make another appearance in Part Two, in the form of the issue of the philosopher's ""nonclaim context"". But while the idea will be present throughout these pages, it will not be much taken up thematically. I understand this idea to require studies in what I should like to call the aesthetics of speech and in he economics of speech. In the former case we follow the fact that understanding what someone says is a function of understanding the intention expressed in his or her saying it, and then the fact that one's intention is a function of what one wants, to a perspective from which responding to what another says is to be seen as demanding a response to (the other's) desire. When in earlier writing of mine I broach the topic ",The Claim of Reason (1972)
" of the modern, I am broaching the topic of art as one in which the connection between expression and desire is purified. In the modern neither he producer nor the consumer has anything to go on (history, convention, genre, form, medium, physiognomy, composition . . .) that secures he value or the significance of an object apart from one's wanting the hing to be as it is. The consequent exercise of criticism is not to determine whether the thing is good that way but why you want it that way -or rather, the problem is to show that these questions are always together. A strictness or scrupulousness of artistic desire thus comes to seem a moral and an intellectual imperative. About the latter case (of an economics of speech), I have said a word or two in The Senses of Walden (pp. 87 ft.) where I point to the vocabulary established in the opening chapter of Walden, entitled ""Economy"", as the fundamental vocabulary of the work as a whole, implying that the question of true necessaries, which it shares as its opening theme with Plato's Republic and with Rousseau's Social Contract, is a question about what we have to say as much as it is about what we have to do; and in the way Thoreau means hem, the one because of the other. My version of Thoreau's answer is in effect that he takes it upon his writing to tell all and to say nothing. - If we formulate the idea that valuing underwrites asserting as the idea that interest informs telling or talking generally, then we may say that the degree to which you talk of things, and talk in ways, that hold no interest for you, or listen to what you cannot imagine the talker's caring about, in he way he carries the care, is the degree to which you consign yourself to nonsensicality, stupify yourself. (Of course your lack of interest may be your fault, come from your own commitment to boredom.) I think of this consignment as a form not so much of dementia as of what amentia ought o mean, a form of mindlessness. It does not appear unthinkable that he bulk of an entire culture, call it the public discourse of the culture, he culture thinking aloud about itself, hence believing itself to be talking philosophy, should become ungovernably inane. In such a case you would not say that the Emperor has no clothes; in part because what you really want to say is that there is no Emperor; but in greater part because in neither case would anyone understand you.)",The Claim of Reason (1972)
"(The foregoing parenthetical remarks were added in 1978, while engaged in a final review of this early material, prompted by my awareness, still little educated, that something like the economics of speech is a mounting topic among theorists of, among other things, literature. See, for example, the Introduction to Marc Shell's The Economy of Literature. I might encourage those as backward or tardy as myself to look at Heidegger's ""The Word of Nietzsche: 'God is Dead' "", which includes (pp. 71 ff.) some paragraphs in response to the question, ""Why is Nietzsche's metaphysics the metaphysics of value?"".)",The Claim of Reason (1972)

"(at any rate, there is no evaluation of a player's intention by the player himself)",The Claim of Reason (1972)
"(This must relate to the absence of room, in games, for akrasia. Everyone who can play the game knows, e.g., that in certain circumstances the outfielders' correct throw is o second base; and everyone who can play the game can make that hrow in those circumstances. What would it mean for a player to say, ""I know the correct play was to second base, but I just couldn't bring myself to make it""?. For a player, knowledge is virtue. In willing the end within the arena of a game - to play the game to win - players, one might say, have willed beforehand the means to that end; what the means are is known beforehand, known how to be practiced, how to be executed. (Some people seem so good at life that it is as if they have somehow beforehand willed all the means necessary to living well, unsurprised either by the pains of enmity or by the hard labors of love. Call such people thoroughly virtuous. Like really good players, they make what they do look easy.) What players can and cannot do seem so purely a function of talent and of physical condition, not of will and spiritual condition. - And yet this is not all there is to the matter. We know that some very spiritual things - such as effort, concentration, discipline, pride, courage - are what makes the difference between equally endowed, alented, and trained players, or overcome discrepancies in these physical dimensions. And events which in particular test endurance - e.g., longdistance running - seem the very image of the exercise of will. So until further study perhaps we should rather say: In games there is not the same room for akrasia as there is outside.)",The Claim of Reason (1972)

"unsaid Antony's figuring of the figure of Christ. I know that what I have said about Coriolanus is pressing me here, that he is in some competition with Christ, as one may say Rome was; but Antony in his narcissistic intimacies seems even less plausibly to invoke Christ than Coriolanus with his narcissistic distances. If one is caught by the self-presentation in the anticipated scene of supper; and by Antony's task as one of standing for, as against Caesar, something Antony thinks of as an incomparable love; and by Enobarbus as moving from the imagination of the supper to a place in which he is imagined as denying Antony [ANT: ""Who's gone this morning?"": ""Who? One ever near thee: call for Enobarbus, He shall not hear thee, or from Caesar's camp Say 'I am none of thine'"" (IV, v)]; and by Antony's thereupon sending Enobarbus's treasure after him [the soldier who tells him this also tells him, ""Your emperor Continues still a Jove"" (IV, vi)], as if rewarding him for playing a part he has assigned to him, as if he is still serving Antony in betraying him; and by the swift death of Enobarbus from himself, feeling himself Judas [by now I hear this allusion in his prayer for death ""That life . . . May hang no longer on me"" (IV, ix)] - caught so, one might think of Antony as a parody of Christ. Then that would mean thinking - taking the play's '""history"" as an interpretation of the ""present"" world - that the human race has become a parody of what we knew, might know, as the human; that human words will at any time parody human meaning. [But who are we to say so?] I make this explicit briefly, in closing, for two reasons. First, to call attention again to the moment, recalled near the close of The Claim of Reason, of Hegel's interpretation of Christianity as the new form of civilization that gives expression to the infinite right of subjective freedom, ""the right of the subject's particularity, his right to be satisfied,"" recalled in order to release a fantasy of ""the vanishing of the human,"" one that links the opposed fates of skepticism and romanticism. In these terms the speculation of Antony and Cleopatra is whether anything short of a new shift of civilization will ""satisfy"" our yet again increased subjectivity. I have said that the play's history is to be taken as of events within Christianity, as in effect stating that something now happening to Christianity, after its advent, is as momentous as that advent itself. One may of course take this as a reaction to the rise of Protestantism. But I am also taking it as the speculation that satisfaction is no longer imaginable within what we understand as religion, that the increasing velocity of the split between subjectivity and objectivity, or between the private and the presentable, no longer permits the common imagination of a significant conclusion. Second, I make explicit the figure of Antony as shadowing that of Christ in order to note that this relation in Shakespeare pertains to his method as well as to his matter; I mean pertains to his use of ""sources,"" a use specified in his source Plutarch as recognizing lives from different cultures as ""parallel."" I seem to see Shakespeare's projection of Antony, as well as of Coriolanus, as saying: In Christendom there is really only one life which ours are fundamentally to be thought of as paralleling [or repeating, or imitating], or failing to, or, say, mocking; and then as questioning whether we can any longer bear up under the parallel of Christ, the consideration of our lives under the concepts of pride, ingratitude, suffering, betrayal, and redemption [from outside]. Being what we call Shakespeare's, his texts will at the same time consider what constitutes the ""parallel"" between [human] lives. Take, for example, the fact that the place at which Plutarch digresses in his life of Antony into an account of Timon of Athens, that is, into his account of Antony's taking upon himself the parallel to Timon - the expression of his sense of the world's ingratitude to his liberality and of the consequent invitation to misanthropy [an essential further link as well with Coriolanus] - this precise place is occupied instead in Shakespeare's recounting by the scene of Antony's heartbreaking, death-dealing magnificence in response to Enobarbus's leaving him. It is to be considered whether and how ""occupied instead"" makes sense. It is given sense if we take the Shakespearean corpus as the place in which each life may inflect any, all as perpetual others, each axiomatically at an unbreachable ",Disowning Knowledge (1987)

"(A test of this would be to consider that the experience of these discoveries - or their proper organ - is as of memory. What precedes certain discoveries is a necessity to return to a work, in fact or in memory, as to unfinished business. And this may be neutral as between rereading and reseeing. Then one recalls that one sense of philosophy takes memory as its organ of knowledge. An outstanding question is then: What sends us back to a piece or a passage? - as though it is not finished with us. In the opening pages of Biographia Literaria, Coleridge takes as his first measure of the worth of a poem the fact that we return to it. Knowing that not just any way of returning will constitute such a measure [say, one in order to prepare for tomorrow's lesson, or to look up an illustration for a thing one already knows], he adds that the return is to be made ""with the greatest pleasure."" But he is not there concerned to characterize the nature of this pleasure, nor our need of it. The trouble with speaking of this returning as a remembering is that it provides access to something we haven't first known and then forgotten. Suppose we say that the experience is one of having to remember. Then one thinks of Wordsworth's rehearsal [in Book VIII of the Prelude] of the motive, and resolution, to know of good and evil, ""not as for the mind's delight but for her safety"" - the feminine cast registering the mind's need for protection, but the masculine drift showing knowledge that such safety is not achieved through protection, but in action. Evidently Wordsworth is not speaking merely of his past, but of the motive, and resolution, to write - write poetry of such ambitions as the poem he is now writing, and thus give to action the body of the past joined with the soul of the present. And why should the need that sends us back to art be disconnected from the necessity upon which the artist goes for it?)",Disowning Knowledge (1987)

But I find on reading this passage, or rather in imagining it said sometimes as by specific actors; Olivier, of course, among them, and the young Brando], that it takes a long time to get through. Partly that has to do with the fact of the repetition of words in the passage; partly with the specific words that are repeated, ""O,"" ""mother,"" and ""believe it. ""It has further to do, I feel sure, with my uncertainty about how long the silences before and within this speech are to be held - a speech that may be understood as expressing the silence with which this son holds, and then relinquishes, his mother's hand. Suppose we try imagining that he does not relinquish her hand until just before the last sentence, ""But let it come"" - as if what is to come is exactly expressive of their separating, or, say, that of Rome from Rome.

"(I have not included George Stevens's W o m a n of the Y e a r in my central group of comedies of remarriage because I do not find it the equal of the six or seven I take as definitive.

It is equally to the point that the older woman in this film, said by Hepburn always to have been her ideal, is not her mother but marries her father late in life, in the course of this film, in a scene that enables the younger woman to try for a reconciliation of her own.)",Pursuits of Happiness
"(It is perhaps worth making explicit that only when a period of culture is reached in which contraception is sufficiently effective and there is sufficient authorization for employing it conscientiously is it pertinent to speak of marriage quite in this way. There was a time-perhaps lived climactically in the generation of the absent mothers-when for a woman prepared to demand the kind of autonomy demanded by the women in our films, chastity, or anyway the absence of intimacy with men, would have presented itself as autonomy's clearest guarantee. The issue then would have been whether to have a recognized sexual existence at all, and hence, if marriage requires a sexual existence, whether to. marry. But then if such a woman as dominates our films does choose to marry, risking children; if, that is, she requires a marriage in which children can be made welcome; then she is looking for a household economy which can undergo this transformation without her being abandoned to motherhood. This all the more for her puts the issue of marriage before the issue of chiIdren. The question of pregnancy is surely one of the reasons that feminism is thought to lack a sense of fun. Yet each of the women of our films is who she is in part because of her sense of fun, a sense apart from which the man in her life does not wish to exist. The question becomes what the conditions are-and first the requirements upon the man-under which that sense of fun can be exercised. So the conditions of the comic become the question of our genre of comedy.)",Pursuits of Happiness

She is, I believe, sometimes found brittle, or shallow, and in any case too obscure in her emotions to warrant and satisfyingly return the attentions paid her by Gable. I have felt this, but my settled view of her in this film is that her performance, though something less than Gable's, is yet a fine match for it. It may be that Colbert lends herself to a kind of abstract view, so that one takes oneself to know what she is like without really looking at her concretely and in detail. I suggest that one make an effort to force oneself away from Gable for a moment and pay special attention to her throughout the sequence of the marriage charade and to the way she delivers her lines before and after she exhibits her leg [""I'll stop a car and I won't use my thumb,"" ""It proves that the limb is mightier than the thumb""].

The genre of remarriage may be said to find the humor in this state of affairs preferable to the humor derivable from a state of affairs in which divorce is not a moral or religious option, to the farce, say, in adultery. The word ""contract,"" at this climactic moment, to my ear names the social contract that was to express the consent that constitutes lawful society, the doctrine that replaces the divine right of kings.

"(The intuition I express of the camera as revealing the reverse sexual nature of its human subjects goes with two other intuitions I have expressed about the camera. First, in connection with The Philadelphia Story, I spoke of the camera as revealing an otherwise invisible self, and I related this to its suggestion of the Blakean Specter and Emanation. Second, in the Foreword to the enlarged edition of The World Viewed, 1 speak of the inherent reflexiveness or self-referentiality of objects filmed and projected on a screen, of the luminosity lendable to projected objects by their ""participation"" [a word meant to pick up Platonic aspirations] in the photographic presenting of themselves, a presence that refers to their absence. 1 wish to understand as an analogue to this ontological speculation about material objects the speculation about human beings, things with consciousness, that their presence refers to their absent, or invisible, or complementary, sexuality. The of objects harks back, in my mind, to the earlier claim in The World Viewed that objects on a screen appear as held in the frame of nature, implying the world as a whole. The sexual reflexiveness of human beings would accordingly suggest the individual as expressing humanity as such, what in The Claim of Reason 1 call the internal relation of each human being with all others.)",Pursuits of Happiness

"(Should someone take the ideas of attitude and of perspective here as being matters of some known element of psychology, say of some particular feeling or matter of will, it may help to say that attitude and perspective enter as well into the constitution of knowledge, the constitution of the world. The difference between taking a statement as true a posteriori or as true a priori can be said to be a difference in the attitude you take toward it. When the hero of Breathless says ""There is no unhappy love,"" he is not, as some may be, leaving the matter open to question, to evidence; for him it is knowledge a priori; you may say a definition. One wants to say here: it is a truth not necessary in all imaginable worlds but necessary in this-I mean in m p w o r l d : ""When I love thee not, chaos is come againM-at that moment there will be no world, things will have gone back to before there is a world. And attitude and perspective, and I suppose something like the same division of attitude and perspective, are at play in the distinction between the factual and the fictional. The question is again how a matter gets opened t experience, and how it is determined by language or, let us say, by narration.

It is what sets off the thing I called in my outline of the film's sequences, at sequence 12b, the transformation of the newspaper photo into an installment of Movietone News. The implication is that the invention of stories about madcap heiresses is the work of scandalmongers, of gossip columnists or of movie review- the abstractness of these claims has its own interest, but it is useful here to the extent that the claims alert us to points of the film's concreteness that we might otherwise slip past. This should become assessible as we now go on to follow certain lines of force through the film.

These are further moments in the vicissitudes of the image of the newspaper that constitutes a feature of the genre of remarriage.

Of course there are withholdings that are manipulative. These are not silent.

The fear of the 'black man,' which is felt by every child, was not the essential thing in that experience; it was, rather, the recognition that stabbed through my childish brain: ""That is a Jesuit."" So the important thing in the dream was its remarkable sym-bolic setting and the astounding interpretation: 'That is the man-eater.' . . . In the dream I went down into the hole in the earth and found something very different onagolden thfone, something non. human and underworldly, which gazed fixedly upward and fed o human flesh. It was only fifty years later that a passage in a study of religious ritual burned into my eyes, concerning the motif of cannj. balism that underlies the symbolism of the Mass. . . : Through this childhood dream I was initiated into the secrets of the earth. What happened then was akind of burial in the earth, and many years were to pass before I came out again.

There was a dead horse in the hollow by the path to my house, which compelled me sometimes to go out of my way, especiallyin the night when the air was heavy, but the assurance it gave me of the strong appetite and inviolable health of Nature was my compensation for this. I love to see that Nature is so rife with life that myriads can be afforded to be sacrificed and suffered to prey on one another; that tender organizations can be so serenely squashed out of existence like pulp,-tadpoles which herons gobble up, and tortoises and toads run over in the road ; and that sometimes it has rained flesh and blood! With the liability to accident, we must see how little account is to be made of it. The impression made ona wise man is that of universal innocence."" Our wisdom is being put to the test here, along with Makavejev's. For the commune can give an impression of innocence, and achieved, only if the work it is doing is the work of nature.

An altogether more important revelation of Last Tango, to my mind, lies in its softcore limitation. Given what this film seems to be about, this limitation acknowledges not a freedom but a limitation that we understand will persist however far the camera will be permitted to go with stars in the future. The camera's metaphysical limitation is that it cannot provide unshakable evidence of the satisfaction of desire any more than the plain eye or ear can provide it-not of the woman's and not, if you are serious about it, of the man's either.

What work of theirs I know does not strike me this way, but I ask nothing for that. My argument can be taken as saying that if they hoped to deflect attention from the individual by deflecting or defeating the concept of the event then this was their error, and it would arise not because there is some extended concept of event they appeal to but because the concept of the uneventful invokes an unchanged or unextended concept of event. Polemics will then have to remain directed upon the question whether the event or the uneventful is the more significant hewer or shaper of human ends, and of whether, or when, or how, one of these is more interesting to the historical sense than the other; which I suppose implies that the question what is to be called history isnot, as raised here, to be decided by what is called an event.)",Themes Out of School

This is the situation in the situation comedy. A certain description of the situation would constitute the formula of the comedy. Then the substitution of the unknown new element to initiate the generation, the element of difference, can be any event that alters the situation comically-Rhoda develops a rash; her sister is being followed by the office lothario; her mother's first boyfriend has just showed up; and so on. A minimum amount of talent is all it takes to write out the results of the generation competently-which of course does not necessarily mean salably; a much higher order is required to invent the characters and relations, and cast them, in such a way as to allow new generations readily and consistently to be funny.)",Themes Out of School

Of course they can be handled all but intolerably, like late-night used car ads, or offers of recordings ""not sold in any store.""

"(Some are bound to feel that the implication for skepticism of the allegory or the psychology of this speculation in the name of Tonio Kroger figures the skeptic's cause in too romantic a vein. Especially when it is recalled that Tonio Kroger speaks early to a confidante of the ""bliss of the commonplace"" as something for which the artist has a ""gnawing, surreptitious hankering"", an inescapable longing ""to live free from the curse of knowledge and the torment of creation, live and praise God in blessed mediocrity!"". Later he locates this longing more fully: ""I stand between two worlds. I am at home in neither, and I suffer in consequence. You artists call me a bourgeois, and the bourgeois try to arrest me. . . . [You] ought to realize that there is a way of being an artist that goes so deep and is so much a matter of origins and destinies that no longing seems o it sweeter and more worth knowing than longing after the bliss of the commonplace."" To the objects of his longing he directs the unvoiced remark: ""It was always you I worked for."" Tonio Kroger's remark is necessarily private from those to whom it is addressed since, as Mann's narrator puts it, "". . . their speech was not his speech"". But I recall also that Tonio Kroger speaks of life - his life, life removed from life - ""as the eternal antinomy of mind and art"", and I ask: Do we take seriously Hume's noting of skeptical doubt as a ""malady which can never radically be cured""?; and do we accept as internal to his philosophy his praise of nature in curing him of his ""philosophical melancholy and delirium"" either ""by relaxing his bent of mind, or by some avocation, and lively impression of my senses"", so that he can follow other philosophers in the practice, or necessary distraction, ""upon leaving their closets"" [i.e., private chambers; studies], of ""[mingling] with the rest of mankind in those exploded opinions""?; and do we think him to be asking sincerely, asking his readers to ask hemselves, whether it follows that ""I must strive against the current of nature, which leads me to indolence and pleasure; that I must seclude myself, in some measure, from the commerce and society of men, which is so agreeable; and that I must torture my brain with subtilities and sophistries, at the very time that I cannot satisfy myself concerning the reasonableness of so painful an application . . . ?

If horror is (also) the reaction to the violation of taboo, say at the fact of incest or of cannibalism, then we must think of the connection between the biological capacity and the social necessity. It suggests itself that these social violations have the force of casting the offender not merely out of this society but outside the human race altogether, as though violation is not of our laws alone, which define our social order, but of the laws that allow human society to exist at all; that, so to speak, raise human relations from an existence in nature. It may be that the violation, if survived and expiated, removes the offender from human nature upward, allows his pure spiritualization rather than his pure corporealization, or rather animalization; as presumably in the case, say, of Oedipus; allows the choosing of the other of the two natures of the human, the unique and precarious combination of which creates the problem.)",The Claim of Reason (1979)

"(Cukor's ""implication beyond the frame"" in the empty bedroom scene is just beyond it to the sides. It thus exploits the typical region of cinematic narrative implication, in which a definite visible something is explicitly denied our view. This possibility has provided cliche devices for local suspense-as when the camera moves in upon a woman's listening face, limiting the view, hence widening the area, of the regions from which something may pounce-or for cowardly or tactful withdrawals from a scene of sexuality or violence. So suspicious have we become, in our freedom, of this mode of implication that any avoidance of the visually explicit may be felt as cowardice. I assume this to be under discussion in the long back-tracking of Hitchcock's camera in Frenzy, recoiling from a scene of implied violence after the shutting of a door in its face. What is implied is not beyond the sides of the frame but beyond its blocked horizon, and the horrified wittiness of the backing gesture is capped when, later showing us what went on behind that door, Hitchcock shows us practically nothing at all of the event, which is again happening beyond the side of the frame or rather below it.61)",The World Viewed (1979)

The immediate pertinence of this history to me is in part to remember the example of Lewis's seriousness and significance as a teacher of philosophy, and again to cite the importance to me of the work of Thompson Clarke, one of the last of Lewis's principal students at Harvard, who would go on to. develop the legacy of classical epistemology with decisive originality.)",A Pitch of Philosophy

Indeed, he might welcome this fact. It indicates that the crisis of our age has deepened, that we are no longer confused, and that we have a chance, at last, to learn what our lives really depend upon. Utterances we have shared about our infinite interests no longer carry any cognitive meaning. Well and good; we have now completely forgotten it. Then it is up to each of us to find our own"" [UKierkegaard's On Authority and Reve-lation,"" pp. 171-172]. This is to be compared with the hearsay accusation against deconstruction to the effect that it holds language to be meaningless, a helpless jab that deconstructionists of my acquaintance have relished the ease of mocking, while none to my knoWledge has articulated its source. Perhaps it is not that hard. Yet the illusoriness in the charge seems to me assayable, if I may say so, in the light of another essay in that first book of mine: uPositivism said that statements about God are meaningless; Beckett shows that they mean too damned much"" [""Ending the Waiting Game,"" p. 120].

Then writing figures the reception of language, of others, as such. Then when Thoreau insists on writing alone, writing only, as opposed to speaking [""a labor of my hands only"" as in his opening paragraph-here, not a labor of my mouth; but this will come forth against the dedication of his mouth to God's words], he is withdrawing his investment in others, taking his voice back to itself, enacting a ""return"" to the presocial [it would take an ""advance"" to the postsocial]; and then his writing figures as it were the states before writing, before its contrast with voicing, before its breaking in [Thoreau will call this ""running amok against him""]. This suggests the level at which what Thoreau calls ""disobedience,"" refusing to listen, makes his neighbors anxious: as if, if society persists in the error of its ways, there is no assurance that society will in the future be able to breakinto metaphysical solitude, that is, that it will be wanted, and consented to.)",In Quest of the Ordinary

"(I note that the years in which Heidegger was beginning to write his last essays, those after his so-called turn from Being and Time, were those in which John Crowe Ransom was writing The World's Body, an-other cffort to link together the fate of poetry and that of the experience of the world. From time to time I wonder [or wonder if it makes sense to wonder] what American intellectual life would have had to be for Ransom to have had a literary-philosophical culture comparable to Heidegger's within which to write. It was that culture, in Europe, that logical positivism had been formed to combat. When positivism was forced to America it found certain affinities with pragmatism as well as certain more intimate enmities with it; and the native intellectual cul-ture had to take positivism on, as it were, single-handedly, hardly know-ing what it was in for, as in the case of Ransom. I do not credit Heidegger with a better touch for literature than Ransom's, or Kenneth Burke's, or R. P. Blackmur', or Paul Goodman's, but the Americans compose their theoretical works in a kind of scrip, good for exchanges at the company store but worth next to nothing on the international market. It may seem a kind of private language. [To say of the New Critics that they composed their theory privately or locally seems to me truer than to say, as I hear it said, that they composed no theory, or little. And then one might look more fruitfully for the cause of what theory they produced.] In bad moments it seems we have had a choice only between this fate of privacy or that of fashion. But perhaps a better moral is a modification of the Mariner's: not everything is expressible in every country.

This is surely tied up with a fact that is too ecstatic in its possibilities not to mention but whose specific implications I am still looking for time o follow out - including some explanation of how I had until recently all but forgotten it - namely the fact that the very line Austin quotes and calls ""classic"" is also quoted in Plato's Symposium (as well as in his Theatetus, as well as in Aristophanes' The Frogs). Socrates in the Symposium cites it about half way through the text, as it becomes his turn to speak, using it specifically as an excuse, and specifically as one which he happily and ironically there-upon gives over, but an excuse to get out of speaking rather than one to get out of keeping silent. So Austin was evidently quoting and inscribing at least the Symposium as much as the Hippolytus. Can one not want to know why? My immediate guess as to what Austin wanted to forget is that the saying of words is not excusable the way the performance of actions is, or in a word, that saying some-hing is after all, or before all, on Austinian grounds not exactly or merely or just or quite or transparently doing something.)",Philosophical Passages

Then what I have been, and will be, saying suggests that the (historical, but not past) synthesis named by and named in the word ""experience"" is reproduced, or recounted, or resynthesized in Emerson's essay of that name. This recounting would be an alternative to Kant's of this idea that ""the conditions of the possibility of experience in general are at the same time the possibility of the objects of experience"" (Critique of Pure Reason, A 158; B 197). Kant's demonstration requires what he calls a ""schematism"" to show how objects are subsumed under or represented to a concept. Emerson's schematism, let me call it, requires a form or genre that synthesizes or transcendentalizes the genres of the conversion narrative, of the slave narrative, and of he narrative of voyage and discovery. For Emerson the forms that subsume - undertake - subjects under a concept (the world under a genre) become the conditions of experience, for his time. - My association of Emerson with Kant on the necessity of a schematism (or temporalization) of forms (for Kant, the forms of judgment which mark concepts; for Emerson the genres of texts that mark narratives) is a proposal for work to be done, I hope by others. Kant says in the section of the first Critique called ""The Schematism of the Pure Concepts of Understanding"" that ""the schemata are thus nothing but a priori determinations of time in accordance with rules"" (A 145; B 184) (determinations ",This New Yet Unapproachable America
"of permanence or succession or coexistence or determinateness in time), which relates the order of categories to the order of ""all possible objects."" Emerson's notation of the determination of time that is necessary to contemporary experience - to the world's now making an impression upon us - is the stepping from Old to New, matters of successions that require conversion, and the aspiration of freedom, and discovery (arrivals, hence departures, abandonings). In ""The American Scholar,"" conversion and its companion idea of transfiguration are Emerson's predicates of thinking. An Emersonian conceptual unfolding of thinking as a conversion or transfiguration (of making an impression, mattering) - as from an Intuition of what counts to a Tuition of how to recount it - is one within which the Kantian ""lines"" between the intelligible and the sensible (say, with Kant, the active and the passive), and between objects for us and things in themselves, are no longer placeable. I would like to say that Emerson's ""Experience"" announces and provides the conditions under which an Emerson essay can be experienced - the conditions of its own possibility. Thus to announce and provide conditions for itself is what makes an essay Emersonian.)",This New Yet Unapproachable America

But if I am convinced that a mouse cannot come into being from those things, then this investiga-ion will perhaps be superfluous. But first we must learn to understand what it is that opposes such an examination of details in philosophy."" I mean this parable to point its finger at me as well as at Rogin's dismissive sketch of Astaire's routine.

So suspicious have we become, in our freedom, of this mode of implication that any avoidance of the visually explicit may be felt as cowardice. I assume this to be under discussion in the long back-tracking of Hitchcock's camera in Frenzy, recoiling from a scene of implied violence after the shutting of a door in its face.

"(If one asks: When must a work, or task, be written, or permanently marked?, one may start thinking what makes a work, or task, memorable. And of course the answer to this alone should not distinguish philosophy from, say, music or poetry or early astronomy or ruler and compass proofs in geometry (or, I wish I knew, what level of logic?). Poetry (some poetry) need not be written; novels must be. It seems to me that a thought I once expressed concerning the development of music relates to this. I said (""Music Discomposed"", pp. 200, 201) that at some point in Beethoven's work you can no longer relate what you hear to a process of improvisation. Here I should like to add the thought that at that point music, such music, must be written. If one may speculate that at such a stage a musical work of art requires parts that are unpredictable from one another (though after the fact, upon analysis, you may say how one is derivable from the other), then one may speculate further that Beethoven's sketches were necessary both because not all ideas are ready for use upon their appearance (because not ready ever in any but their right company), and also because not all are usable in their initial appearance, but must first, as it were, grow outside the womb. What must be sketched must be written. If what is in a sketch book is jotted just for saving, just to await its company, with which it is then juxtaposed as it stands, you may say the juxtaposition, or composition, is that of the lyric. If it is sketched knowing that it must be, and gets in time, transformed in order to take its place, you may say that its juxtaposition, or composition, is essentially stratified and partitioned; that of the drama; the drama of the meta-physical, or of the sonata.

A main use of the examples about pointing is to show that the difference between them is not determined by a particular feeling which accompanies the pointing - not in what is going on hen and there - but in what happens before and after, the circumstances of the act. The examples for concentrating one's attention are used to illustrate a different emphasis, viz., that there may be many different such characteristic accompanying feelings, some common, some not, but no one of them essential hence none a candidate capable of doing what we hought only a particular feeling could do. No harm, I think, need come from this, but this unmarked shift from ""pointing"" to ""concentrating"" is surprising in view of Wittgenstein's severe caution that we not take ""concentrating on a sensation"" as a private ostensive definition, i.e., as a way of pointing to a sensation.)",The Claim of Reason

"(If to what we call something and to what we count as something we add the notion of what we claim something to be, we have gathered together the major modes in which we have invoked the fact of talking, he work of wording the world; and if to the pairs telling and counting, and counting and claiming, and claiming and acclaiming or clamoring, hence proclaiming and announcing, and denouncing and renouncing, and counting and recounting, or recounting and accounting, we add the notions of calling to account or accusing, hence excusing and explaining, and add computing and hence reputing and imputing; what we seem headed for is an idea that what can comprehensibly be said is what is found to be worth saying. This explicitly makes our agreement in judgment, our attunement expressed through criteria, agreement in valuing. So that what can be communicated, say a fact, depends upon agreement in valuing, rather than the other way around. This is what our speech acts come to, or come from. Such an idea arose at the beginning of our consideration of Wittgenstein's notion of a criterion when we had to say that his notion seemed to make statements of fact turn on the same background of necessities and agreements that judgments of value explicitly do. It comes up again in beginning to weigh Austin's findings that epistemological assessments, assessments of our offerings of knowledge, can come from curiosity, from suspicion, or from a demand to know the special reason which makes a question (as to the reality of an object) reasonable. Here I am thinking of the special reason as the thing which makes the question worth asking. The idea of valuing as the other face of asserting will make another appearance in Part Two, in the form of the issue of the philosopher's ""nonclaim context"". But while the idea will be present throughout these pages, it will not be much taken up thematically. I understand this idea to require studies in what I should like to call the aesthetics of speech and in he economics of speech. In the former case we follow the fact that understanding what someone says is a function of understanding the intention expressed in his or her saying it, and then the fact that one's intention is a function of what one wants, to a perspective from which responding to what another says is to be seen as demanding a response to (the other's) desire. When in earlier writing of mine I broach the topic ",The Claim of Reason
" of the modern, I am broaching the topic of art as one in which the connection between expression and desire is purified. In the modern neither he producer nor the consumer has anything to go on (history, convention, genre, form, medium, physiognomy, composition . . .) that secures he value or the significance of an object apart from one's wanting the hing to be as it is. The consequent exercise of criticism is not to determine whether the thing is good that way but why you want it that way -or rather, the problem is to show that these questions are always together. A strictness or scrupulousness of artistic desire thus comes to seem a moral and an intellectual imperative. About the latter case (of an economics of speech), I have said a word or two in The Senses of Walden (pp. 87 ft.) where I point to the vocabulary established in the opening chapter of Walden, entitled ""Economy"", as the fundamental vocabulary of the work as a whole, implying that the question of true necessaries, which it shares as its opening theme with Plato's Republic and with Rousseau's Social Contract, is a question about what we have to say as much as it is about what we have to do; and in the way Thoreau means hem, the one because of the other. My version of Thoreau's answer is in effect that he takes it upon his writing to tell all and to say nothing. - If we formulate the idea that valuing underwrites asserting as the idea that interest informs telling or talking generally, then we may say that the degree to which you talk of things, and talk in ways, that hold no interest for you, or listen to what you cannot imagine the talker's caring about, in he way he carries the care, is the degree to which you consign yourself to nonsensicality, stupify yourself. (Of course your lack of interest may be your fault, come from your own commitment to boredom.) I think of this consignment as a form not so much of dementia as of what amentia ought o mean, a form of mindlessness. It does not appear unthinkable that he bulk of an entire culture, call it the public discourse of the culture, he culture thinking aloud about itself, hence believing itself to be talking philosophy, should become ungovernably inane. In such a case you would not say that the Emperor has no clothes; in part because what you really want to say is that there is no Emperor; but in greater part because in neither case would anyone understand you.)",The Claim of Reason
"(The foregoing parenthetical remarks were added in 1978, while engaged in a final review of this early material, prompted by my awareness, still little educated, that something like the economics of speech is a mounting topic among theorists of, among other things, literature. See, for example, the Introduction to Marc Shell's The Economy of Literature.

What would it mean for a player to say, ""I know the correct play was to second base, but I just couldn't bring myself to make it""?. For a player, knowledge is virtue. In willing the end within the arena of a game - to play the game to win - players, one might say, have willed beforehand the means to that end; what the means are is known beforehand, known how to be practiced, how to be executed. (Some people seem so good at life that it is as if they have somehow beforehand willed all the means necessary to living well, unsurprised either by the pains of enmity or by the hard labors of love. Call such people thoroughly virtuous. Like really good players, they make what they do look easy.) What players can and cannot do seem so purely a function of talent and of physical condition, not of will and spiritual condition. - And yet this is not all there is to the matter. We know that some very spiritual things - such as effort, concentration, discipline, pride, courage - are what makes the difference between equally endowed, alented, and trained players, or overcome discrepancies in these physical dimensions. And events which in particular test endurance - e.g., longdistance running - seem the very image of the exercise of will.

If horror is (also) the reaction to the violation of taboo, say at the fact of incest or of cannibalism, then we must think of the connection between the biological capacity and the social necessity. It suggests itself that these social violations have the force of casting the offender not merely out of this society but outside the human race altogether, as though violation is not of our laws alone, which define our social order, but of the laws that allow human society to exist at all; that, so to speak, raise human relations from an existence in nature. It may be that the violation, if survived and expiated, removes the offender from human nature upward, allows his pure spiritualization rather than his pure corporealization, or rather animalization; as presumably in the case, say, of Oedipus; allows the choosing of the other of the two natures of the human, the unique and precarious combination of which creates the problem.)",The Claim of Reason
