"(This new significance in philosophical repudiation itself has a history. Its most obvious precursor is Hegel, but it begins, I believe, in Kant. For it is in Kant that one finds an explicit recognition that the terms in which the past is criticized are specific to one's own position, and require justification from within that position. A clear instance of such a Kantian term of criticism is his characterization of an opposed ""Idealism"" as making the world ""empirically ideal and transcendentally real""; another is his diagnosis of ""dialectical illusion."")",Must We Mean What We Say?

"(It would make no sense to speak of someone as a gifted novelist who had never written a novel; nor of someone as a scientist who had made no contribution to science. In the case of the scientist, the contribution need not be his own writing; but one could say that he must affect what his field writes. His contribution, that is, may be oral, but it must affect a tradition which is essentially not oral; this suggests that such contributions must be exceptional. It indicates further that writing plays differing roles. in different enterprises, even that ""writing"" means something different, or has a different inflection, in contexts like ""writing a novel,"" ""writing a fugue,"" ""writing a report,"" ""writing (up) an experiment,"" ""writing (down) a proof.""

And that would mean that philosophy, as it has been known, is past.

"(A test of this would be to consider that the experience of these discoveries-or their proper organ-is as of memory. What precedes certain discoveries is a necessity to return to a work, in fact or in memory, as to unfinished business. And this may be neutral as between re.reading and re-seeing. Then one recalls that one sense of philosophy takes memory as its organ of knowledge. An outstanding question is then: What sends us back to a piece or a passage?-as though it is not finished with us. In the opening pages of Biographia Literaria, Coleridge takes as his first measure of the worth of a poem the fact that we return to it. Knowing that not just any way of returning will constitute such a measure (say, one in order to prepare for tomorrow's lesson, or to look up an illustration for a thing one already knows), he adds that the return is to be made ""with the greatest pleasure."" But he is not there concerned to characterize the nature of this pleasure, nor our need of it. The trouble with speaking of this returning as a remembering is that it provides access to something we haven't first known and then forgotten. Suppose we say that the experience is one of having to remember. Then one thinks of Wordsworth's rehearsal (in Book VIII of the Prelude) of the motive, and resolution, to know of good and evil, ""not as for the mind's delight but for her safety""-the feminine cast registering the mind's need for protection, but the masculine drift showing knowledge that such safety is not achieved through protection, but in action. Evidently Wordsworth is not speaking merely of his past, but of the motive, and resolution, to write-write poetry of such ambitions as the poem he is now writing, and thus give to action the body of the past joined with the soul of the present. And why should the need that sends us back to art be disconnected from the necessity upon which the artist goes for it?)",Must We Mean What We Say?

"(If one asks: When must a work, or task, be written, or permanently marked?, one may start thinking what makes a work, or task, memorable. And of course the answer to this alone should not distinguish philosophy from, say, music or poetry or early astronomy or ruler and compass proofs in geometry (or, I wish I knew, what level of logic?). Poetry (some poetry) need not be written; novels must be. It seems to me that a thought I once expressed concerning the development of music relates to this. I said (""Music Discomposed"", pp. 200, 201) that at some point in Beethoven's work you can no longer relate what you hear to a process of improvisation. Here I should like to add the thought that at that point music, such music, must be written. If one may speculate that at such a stage a musical work of art requires parts that are unpredictable from one another (though after the fact, upon analysis, you may say how one is derivable from the other), then one may speculate further that Beethoven's sketches were necessary both because not all ideas are ready for use upon their appearance (because not ready ever in any but their right company), and also because not all are usable in their initial appearance, but must first, as it were, grow outside the womb. What must be sketched must be written. If what is in a sketch book is jotted just for saving, just to await its company, with which it is then juxtaposed as it stands, you may say the juxtaposition, or composition, is that of the lyric. If it is sketched knowing that it must be, and gets in time, transformed in order to take its place, you may say that its juxtaposition, or composition, is essentially stratified and partitioned; that of the drama; the drama of the meta-physical, or of the sonata.

"(It may be significant that in the two passages in which the examples of ""pointing o an object"" and ""pointing to its color"" occur, Wittgenstein does not actually provide language games for pointing at all, but moves quickly o remarks about concentrating one's attention; and at ?33 he goes on to give varying contexts for that. A main use of the examples about pointing is to show that the difference between them is not determined by a particular feeling which accompanies the pointing - not in what is going on hen and there - but in what happens before and after, the circumstances of the act. The examples for concentrating one's attention are used to illustrate a different emphasis, viz., that there may be many different such characteristic accompanying feelings, some common, some not, but no one of them essential hence none a candidate capable of doing what we hought only a particular feeling could do. No harm, I think, need come from this, but this unmarked shift from ""pointing"" to ""concentrating"" is surprising in view of Wittgenstein's severe caution that we not take ""concentrating on a sensation"" as a private ostensive definition, i.e., as a way of pointing to a sensation.)",The Claim of Reason (1972)

"(If to what we call something and to what we count as something we add the notion of what we claim something to be, we have gathered together the major modes in which we have invoked the fact of talking, he work of wording the world; and if to the pairs telling and counting, and counting and claiming, and claiming and acclaiming or clamoring, hence proclaiming and announcing, and denouncing and renouncing, and counting and recounting, or recounting and accounting, we add the notions of calling to account or accusing, hence excusing and explaining, and add computing and hence reputing and imputing; what we seem headed for is an idea that what can comprehensibly be said is what is found to be worth saying. This explicitly makes our agreement in judgment, our attunement expressed through criteria, agreement in valuing. So that what can be communicated, say a fact, depends upon agreement in valuing, rather than the other way around. This is what our speech acts come to, or come from. Such an idea arose at the beginning of our consideration of Wittgenstein's notion of a criterion when we had to say that his notion seemed to make statements of fact turn on the same background of necessities and agreements that judgments of value explicitly do. It comes up again in beginning to weigh Austin's findings that epistemological assessments, assessments of our offerings of knowledge, can come from curiosity, from suspicion, or from a demand to know the special reason which makes a question (as to the reality of an object) reasonable. Here I am thinking of the special reason as the thing which makes the question worth asking. The idea of valuing as the other face of asserting will make another appearance in Part Two, in the form of the issue of the philosopher's ""nonclaim context"". But while the idea will be present throughout these pages, it will not be much taken up thematically. I understand this idea to require studies in what I should like to call the aesthetics of speech and in he economics of speech. In the former case we follow the fact that understanding what someone says is a function of understanding the intention expressed in his or her saying it, and then the fact that one's intention is a function of what one wants, to a perspective from which responding to what another says is to be seen as demanding a response to (the other's) desire. When in earlier writing of mine I broach the topic ",The Claim of Reason (1972)
" of the modern, I am broaching the topic of art as one in which the connection between expression and desire is purified. In the modern neither he producer nor the consumer has anything to go on (history, convention, genre, form, medium, physiognomy, composition . . .) that secures he value or the significance of an object apart from one's wanting the hing to be as it is. The consequent exercise of criticism is not to determine whether the thing is good that way but why you want it that way -or rather, the problem is to show that these questions are always together. A strictness or scrupulousness of artistic desire thus comes to seem a moral and an intellectual imperative. About the latter case (of an economics of speech), I have said a word or two in The Senses of Walden (pp. 87 ft.) where I point to the vocabulary established in the opening chapter of Walden, entitled ""Economy"", as the fundamental vocabulary of the work as a whole, implying that the question of true necessaries, which it shares as its opening theme with Plato's Republic and with Rousseau's Social Contract, is a question about what we have to say as much as it is about what we have to do; and in the way Thoreau means hem, the one because of the other. My version of Thoreau's answer is in effect that he takes it upon his writing to tell all and to say nothing. - If we formulate the idea that valuing underwrites asserting as the idea that interest informs telling or talking generally, then we may say that the degree to which you talk of things, and talk in ways, that hold no interest for you, or listen to what you cannot imagine the talker's caring about, in he way he carries the care, is the degree to which you consign yourself to nonsensicality, stupify yourself. (Of course your lack of interest may be your fault, come from your own commitment to boredom.) I think of this consignment as a form not so much of dementia as of what amentia ought o mean, a form of mindlessness. It does not appear unthinkable that he bulk of an entire culture, call it the public discourse of the culture, he culture thinking aloud about itself, hence believing itself to be talking philosophy, should become ungovernably inane. In such a case you would not say that the Emperor has no clothes; in part because what you really want to say is that there is no Emperor; but in greater part because in neither case would anyone understand you.)",The Claim of Reason (1972)

"(This must relate to the absence of room, in games, for akrasia.

What would it mean for a player to say, ""I know the correct play was to second base, but I just couldn't bring myself to make it""?. For a player, knowledge is virtue. In willing the end within the arena of a game - to play the game to win - players, one might say, have willed beforehand the means to that end; what the means are is known beforehand, known how to be practiced, how to be executed. (Some people seem so good at life that it is as if they have somehow beforehand willed all the means necessary to living well, unsurprised either by the pains of enmity or by the hard labors of love. Call such people thoroughly virtuous. Like really good players, they make what they do look easy.) What players can and cannot do seem so purely a function of talent and of physical condition, not of will and spiritual condition. - And yet this is not all there is to the matter. We know that some very spiritual things - such as effort, concentration, discipline, pride, courage - are what makes the difference between equally endowed, alented, and trained players, or overcome discrepancies in these physical dimensions. And events which in particular test endurance - e.g., longdistance running - seem the very image of the exercise of will. So until further study perhaps we should rather say: In games there is not the same room for akrasia as there is outside.)",The Claim of Reason (1972)

"unsaid Antony's figuring of the figure of Christ. I know that what I have said about Coriolanus is pressing me here, that he is in some competition with Christ, as one may say Rome was; but Antony in his narcissistic intimacies seems even less plausibly to invoke Christ than Coriolanus with his narcissistic distances. If one is caught by the self-presentation in the anticipated scene of supper; and by Antony's task as one of standing for, as against Caesar, something Antony thinks of as an incomparable love; and by Enobarbus as moving from the imagination of the supper to a place in which he is imagined as denying Antony [ANT: ""Who's gone this morning?"": ""Who? One ever near thee: call for Enobarbus, He shall not hear thee, or from Caesar's camp Say 'I am none of thine'"" (IV, v)]; and by Antony's thereupon sending Enobarbus's treasure after him [the soldier who tells him this also tells him, ""Your emperor Continues still a Jove"" (IV, vi)], as if rewarding him for playing a part he has assigned to him, as if he is still serving Antony in betraying him; and by the swift death of Enobarbus from himself, feeling himself Judas [by now I hear this allusion in his prayer for death ""That life . . . May hang no longer on me"" (IV, ix)] - caught so, one might think of Antony as a parody of Christ. Then that would mean thinking - taking the play's '""history"" as an interpretation of the ""present"" world - that the human race has become a parody of what we knew, might know, as the human; that human words will at any time parody human meaning. [But who are we to say so?] I make this explicit briefly, in closing, for two reasons. First, to call attention again to the moment, recalled near the close of The Claim of Reason, of Hegel's interpretation of Christianity as the new form of civilization that gives expression to the infinite right of subjective freedom, ""the right of the subject's particularity, his right to be satisfied,"" recalled in order to release a fantasy of ""the vanishing of the human,"" one that links the opposed fates of skepticism and romanticism. In these terms the speculation of Antony and Cleopatra is whether anything short of a new shift of civilization will ""satisfy"" our yet again increased subjectivity. I have said that the play's history is to be taken as of events within Christianity, as in effect stating that something now happening to Christianity, after its advent, is as momentous as that advent itself. One may of course take this as a reaction to the rise of Protestantism. But I am also taking it as the speculation that satisfaction is no longer imaginable within what we understand as religion, that the increasing velocity of the split between subjectivity and objectivity, or between the private and the presentable, no longer permits the common imagination of a significant conclusion. Second, I make explicit the figure of Antony as shadowing that of Christ in order to note that this relation in Shakespeare pertains to his method as well as to his matter; I mean pertains to his use of ""sources,"" a use specified in his source Plutarch as recognizing lives from different cultures as ""parallel."" I seem to see Shakespeare's projection of Antony, as well as of Coriolanus, as saying: In Christendom there is really only one life which ours are fundamentally to be thought of as paralleling [or repeating, or imitating], or failing to, or, say, mocking; and then as questioning whether we can any longer bear up under the parallel of Christ, the consideration of our lives under the concepts of pride, ingratitude, suffering, betrayal, and redemption [from outside]. Being what we call Shakespeare's, his texts will at the same time consider what constitutes the ""parallel"" between [human] lives. Take, for example, the fact that the place at which Plutarch digresses in his life of Antony into an account of Timon of Athens, that is, into his account of Antony's taking upon himself the parallel to Timon - the expression of his sense of the world's ingratitude to his liberality and of the consequent invitation to misanthropy [an essential further link as well with Coriolanus] - this precise place is occupied instead in Shakespeare's recounting by the scene of Antony's heartbreaking, death-dealing magnificence in response to Enobarbus's leaving him. It is to be considered whether and how ""occupied instead"" makes sense. It is given sense if we take the Shakespearean corpus as the place in which each life may inflect any, all as perpetual others, each axiomatically at an unbreachable ",Disowning Knowledge (1987)

Because the connection between using a word and meaning what it says is not inevitable or automatic, one may wish to call it a matter of convention. But then one must not suppose that it is a convention we would know how to forgo.

"(A test of this would be to consider that the experience of these discoveries - or their proper organ - is as of memory. What precedes certain discoveries is a necessity to return to a work, in fact or in memory, as to unfinished business. And this may be neutral as between rereading and reseeing. Then one recalls that one sense of philosophy takes memory as its organ of knowledge. An outstanding question is then: What sends us back to a piece or a passage? - as though it is not finished with us. In the opening pages of Biographia Literaria, Coleridge takes as his first measure of the worth of a poem the fact that we return to it. Knowing that not just any way of returning will constitute such a measure [say, one in order to prepare for tomorrow's lesson, or to look up an illustration for a thing one already knows], he adds that the return is to be made ""with the greatest pleasure."" But he is not there concerned to characterize the nature of this pleasure, nor our need of it. The trouble with speaking of this returning as a remembering is that it provides access to something we haven't first known and then forgotten. Suppose we say that the experience is one of having to remember. Then one thinks of Wordsworth's rehearsal [in Book VIII of the Prelude] of the motive, and resolution, to know of good and evil, ""not as for the mind's delight but for her safety"" - the feminine cast registering the mind's need for protection, but the masculine drift showing knowledge that such safety is not achieved through protection, but in action. Evidently Wordsworth is not speaking merely of his past, but of the motive, and resolution, to write - write poetry of such ambitions as the poem he is now writing, and thus give to action the body of the past joined with the soul of the present. And why should the need that sends us back to art be disconnected from the necessity upon which the artist goes for it?)",Disowning Knowledge (1987)

By the way, the only claim among related comedies I know that a child is justified apart from marriage, even apart from any stable relationship with a man, merely on the ground that you bore it and want it and can make it happy, occurs in Bergman's Smiles of a Summer Night, I suppose the last comedy to study remarriage.)",Pursuits of Happiness
"(It is perhaps worth making explicit that only when a period of culture is reached in which contraception is sufficiently effective and there is sufficient authorization for employing it conscientiously is it pertinent to speak of marriage quite in this way. There was a time-perhaps lived climactically in the generation of the absent mothers-when for a woman prepared to demand the kind of autonomy demanded by the women in our films, chastity, or anyway the absence of intimacy with men, would have presented itself as autonomy's clearest guarantee. The issue then would have been whether to have a recognized sexual existence at all, and hence, if marriage requires a sexual existence, whether to. marry. But then if such a woman as dominates our films does choose to marry, risking children; if, that is, she requires a marriage in which children can be made welcome; then she is looking for a household economy which can undergo this transformation without her being abandoned to motherhood. This all the more for her puts the issue of marriage before the issue of chiIdren. The question of pregnancy is surely one of the reasons that feminism is thought to lack a sense of fun. Yet each of the women of our films is who she is in part because of her sense of fun, a sense apart from which the man in her life does not wish to exist. The question becomes what the conditions are-and first the requirements upon the man-under which that sense of fun can be exercised. So the conditions of the comic become the question of our genre of comedy.)",Pursuits of Happiness

I suggest that one make an effort to force oneself away from Gable for a moment and pay special attention to her throughout the sequence of the marriage charade and to the way she delivers her lines before and after she exhibits her leg [""I'll stop a car and I won't use my thumb,"" ""It proves that the limb is mightier than the thumb""].

The genre of remarriage may be said to find the humor in this state of affairs preferable to the humor derivable from a state of affairs in which divorce is not a moral or religious option, to the farce, say, in adultery. The word ""contract,"" at this climactic moment, to my ear names the social contract that was to express the consent that constitutes lawful society, the doctrine that replaces the divine right of kings.

It is what sets off the thing I called in my outline of the film's sequences, at sequence 12b, the transformation of the newspaper photo into an installment of Movietone News. The implication is that the invention of stories about madcap heiresses is the work of scandalmongers, of gossip columnists or of movie review- the abstractness of these claims has its own interest, but it is useful here to the extent that the claims alert us to points of the film's concreteness that we might otherwise slip past. This should become assessible as we now go on to follow certain lines of force through the film.

These are further moments in the vicissitudes of the image of the newspaper that constitutes a feature of the genre of remarriage.

Of course there are withholdings that are manipulative. These are not silent.

My argument can be taken as saying that if they hoped to deflect attention from the individual by deflecting or defeating the concept of the event then this was their error, and it would arise not because there is some extended concept of event they appeal to but because the concept of the uneventful invokes an unchanged or unextended concept of event. Polemics will then have to remain directed upon the question whether the event or the uneventful is the more significant hewer or shaper of human ends, and of whether, or when, or how, one of these is more interesting to the historical sense than the other; which I suppose implies that the question what is to be called history isnot, as raised here, to be decided by what is called an event.)",Themes Out of School

This is the situation in the situation comedy. A certain description of the situation would constitute the formula of the comedy. Then the substitution of the unknown new element to initiate the generation, the element of difference, can be any event that alters the situation comically-Rhoda develops a rash; her sister is being followed by the office lothario; her mother's first boyfriend has just showed up; and so on. A minimum amount of talent is all it takes to write out the results of the generation competently-which of course does not necessarily mean salably; a much higher order is required to invent the characters and relations, and cast them, in such a way as to allow new generations readily and consistently to be funny.)",Themes Out of School

What the effort, or claim, to favor commercials over programs suggests to me is that the aesthetic position of commercials, what you might call their possibility-what makes them aesthetically possible rather than merely intolerable-is not their inherent aesthetic interest (one would not sit still, with mild interest, for periodic minute-length transmissions of, say, a passage of Garbo's face or of a Chaplin routine: these glimpses of the masterful would be pointless), but the fact that they are readable, not as interruptions, but as interludes. Of course they can be handled all but intolerably, like late-night used car ads, or offers of recordings ""not sold in any store.""

If horror is (also) the reaction to the violation of taboo, say at the fact of incest or of cannibalism, then we must think of the connection between the biological capacity and the social necessity. It suggests itself that these social violations have the force of casting the offender not merely out of this society but outside the human race altogether, as though violation is not of our laws alone, which define our social order, but of the laws that allow human society to exist at all; that, so to speak, raise human relations from an existence in nature. It may be that the violation, if survived and expiated, removes the offender from human nature upward, allows his pure spiritualization rather than his pure corporealization, or rather animalization; as presumably in the case, say, of Oedipus; allows the choosing of the other of the two natures of the human, the unique and precarious combination of which creates the problem.)",The Claim of Reason (1979)

"(Cukor's ""implication beyond the frame"" in the empty bedroom scene is just beyond it to the sides. It thus exploits the typical region of cinematic narrative implication, in which a definite visible something is explicitly denied our view. This possibility has provided cliche devices for local suspense-as when the camera moves in upon a woman's listening face, limiting the view, hence widening the area, of the regions from which something may pounce-or for cowardly or tactful withdrawals from a scene of sexuality or violence. So suspicious have we become, in our freedom, of this mode of implication that any avoidance of the visually explicit may be felt as cowardice. I assume this to be under discussion in the long back-tracking of Hitchcock's camera in Frenzy, recoiling from a scene of implied violence after the shutting of a door in its face. What is implied is not beyond the sides of the frame but beyond its blocked horizon, and the horrified wittiness of the backing gesture is capped when, later showing us what went on behind that door, Hitchcock shows us practically nothing at all of the event, which is again happening beyond the side of the frame or rather below it.61)",The World Viewed (1979)

It indicates that the crisis of our age has deepened, that we are no longer confused, and that we have a chance, at last, to learn what our lives really depend upon.

"(I note that the years in which Heidegger was beginning to write his last essays, those after his so-called turn from Being and Time, were those in which John Crowe Ransom was writing The World's Body, an-other cffort to link together the fate of poetry and that of the experience of the world. From time to time I wonder [or wonder if it makes sense to wonder] what American intellectual life would have had to be for Ransom to have had a literary-philosophical culture comparable to Heidegger's within which to write. It was that culture, in Europe, that logical positivism had been formed to combat. When positivism was forced to America it found certain affinities with pragmatism as well as certain more intimate enmities with it; and the native intellectual cul-ture had to take positivism on, as it were, single-handedly, hardly know-ing what it was in for, as in the case of Ransom. I do not credit Heidegger with a better touch for literature than Ransom's, or Kenneth Burke's, or R. P. Blackmur', or Paul Goodman's, but the Americans compose their theoretical works in a kind of scrip, good for exchanges at the company store but worth next to nothing on the international market. It may seem a kind of private language. [To say of the New Critics that they composed their theory privately or locally seems to me truer than to say, as I hear it said, that they composed no theory, or little. And then one might look more fruitfully for the cause of what theory they produced.] In bad moments it seems we have had a choice only between this fate of privacy or that of fashion.

Then what I have been, and will be, saying suggests that the (historical, but not past) synthesis named by and named in the word ""experience"" is reproduced, or recounted, or resynthesized in Emerson's essay of that name. This recounting would be an alternative to Kant's of this idea that ""the conditions of the possibility of experience in general are at the same time the possibility of the objects of experience"" (Critique of Pure Reason, A 158; B 197). Kant's demonstration requires what he calls a ""schematism"" to show how objects are subsumed under or represented to a concept. Emerson's schematism, let me call it, requires a form or genre that synthesizes or transcendentalizes the genres of the conversion narrative, of the slave narrative, and of he narrative of voyage and discovery. For Emerson the forms that subsume - undertake - subjects under a concept (the world under a genre) become the conditions of experience, for his time. - My association of Emerson with Kant on the necessity of a schematism (or temporalization) of forms (for Kant, the forms of judgment which mark concepts; for Emerson the genres of texts that mark narratives) is a proposal for work to be done, I hope by others. Kant says in the section of the first Critique called ""The Schematism of the Pure Concepts of Understanding"" that ""the schemata are thus nothing but a priori determinations of time in accordance with rules"" (A 145; B 184) (determinations ",This New Yet Unapproachable America
"of permanence or succession or coexistence or determinateness in time), which relates the order of categories to the order of ""all possible objects."" Emerson's notation of the determination of time that is necessary to contemporary experience - to the world's now making an impression upon us - is the stepping from Old to New, matters of successions that require conversion, and the aspiration of freedom, and discovery (arrivals, hence departures, abandonings). In ""The American Scholar,"" conversion and its companion idea of transfiguration are Emerson's predicates of thinking. An Emersonian conceptual unfolding of thinking as a conversion or transfiguration (of making an impression, mattering) - as from an Intuition of what counts to a Tuition of how to recount it - is one within which the Kantian ""lines"" between the intelligible and the sensible (say, with Kant, the active and the passive), and between objects for us and things in themselves, are no longer placeable.

I would have known, had the possibility crossed my mind, that symphonies and concertos and operas would not fit on a single record, not of course even a twelve-inch record, even on both sides. So what caused my surprise in encountering these albums? I seem to need some concept of accelerating ignorance, an increasing quantity measuring per day the connections not made and implications not drawn by me. I early concluded that if I were to amount to anything, it would derive from finding the fruitfulness of trancelike states of mine in which everything is news to me, as if everything real has to be born in me. It is not an ingratiating quality. Yet Abraham's Sarah laughed at improbable pregnancy.-Then why not ingratiating? That there is some early narcissistic investment in play here I do not doubt. Early narcissism may be thought of as a kind of necessary, if dangerous, postponement, say, a suspended recognition of separation, of a world apart from me, a wish to show oneself, to make oneself, hence one's work, worthy of love.

This possibility has provided cliche devices for local suspense-as when the camera moves in upon a woman's listening face, limiting the view, hence widening the area, of the regions from which something may pounce-or for cowardly or tactful withdrawals from a scene of sexuality or violence. So suspicious have we become, in our freedom, of this mode of implication that any avoidance of the visually explicit may be felt as cowardice. I assume this to be under discussion in the long back-tracking of Hitchcock's camera in Frenzy, recoiling from a scene of implied violence after the shutting of a door in its face. What is implied is not beyond the sides of the frame but beyond its blocked horizon, and the horrified wittiness of the backing gesture is capped when, later showing us what went on behind that door, Hitchcock shows us practically nothing at all of the event, which is again happening beyond the side of the frame or rather below it.61)",The World Viewed

"(If one asks: When must a work, or task, be written, or permanently marked?, one may start thinking what makes a work, or task, memorable. And of course the answer to this alone should not distinguish philosophy from, say, music or poetry or early astronomy or ruler and compass proofs in geometry (or, I wish I knew, what level of logic?). Poetry (some poetry) need not be written; novels must be. It seems to me that a thought I once expressed concerning the development of music relates to this. I said (""Music Discomposed"", pp. 200, 201) that at some point in Beethoven's work you can no longer relate what you hear to a process of improvisation. Here I should like to add the thought that at that point music, such music, must be written. If one may speculate that at such a stage a musical work of art requires parts that are unpredictable from one another (though after the fact, upon analysis, you may say how one is derivable from the other), then one may speculate further that Beethoven's sketches were necessary both because not all ideas are ready for use upon their appearance (because not ready ever in any but their right company), and also because not all are usable in their initial appearance, but must first, as it were, grow outside the womb. What must be sketched must be written. If what is in a sketch book is jotted just for saving, just to await its company, with which it is then juxtaposed as it stands, you may say the juxtaposition, or composition, is that of the lyric. If it is sketched knowing that it must be, and gets in time, transformed in order to take its place, you may say that its juxtaposition, or composition, is essentially stratified and partitioned; that of the drama; the drama of the meta-physical, or of the sonata.

A main use of the examples about pointing is to show that the difference between them is not determined by a particular feeling which accompanies the pointing - not in what is going on hen and there - but in what happens before and after, the circumstances of the act. The examples for concentrating one's attention are used to illustrate a different emphasis, viz., that there may be many different such characteristic accompanying feelings, some common, some not, but no one of them essential hence none a candidate capable of doing what we hought only a particular feeling could do. No harm, I think, need come from this, but this unmarked shift from ""pointing"" to ""concentrating"" is surprising in view of Wittgenstein's severe caution that we not take ""concentrating on a sensation"" as a private ostensive definition, i.e., as a way of pointing to a sensation.)",The Claim of Reason

This explicitly makes our agreement in judgment, our attunement expressed through criteria, agreement in valuing. So that what can be communicated, say a fact, depends upon agreement in valuing, rather than the other way around. This is what our speech acts come to, or come from. Such an idea arose at the beginning of our consideration of Wittgenstein's notion of a criterion when we had to say that his notion seemed to make statements of fact turn on the same background of necessities and agreements that judgments of value explicitly do. It comes up again in beginning to weigh Austin's findings that epistemological assessments, assessments of our offerings of knowledge, can come from curiosity, from suspicion, or from a demand to know the special reason which makes a question (as to the reality of an object) reasonable. Here I am thinking of the special reason as the thing which makes the question worth asking. The idea of valuing as the other face of asserting will make another appearance in Part Two, in the form of the issue of the philosopher's ""nonclaim context"". But while the idea will be present throughout these pages, it will not be much taken up thematically. I understand this idea to require studies in what I should like to call the aesthetics of speech and in he economics of speech. In the former case we follow the fact that understanding what someone says is a function of understanding the intention expressed in his or her saying it, and then the fact that one's intention is a function of what one wants, to a perspective from which responding to what another says is to be seen as demanding a response to (the other's) desire. When in earlier writing of mine I broach the topic ",The Claim of Reason
" of the modern, I am broaching the topic of art as one in which the connection between expression and desire is purified. In the modern neither he producer nor the consumer has anything to go on (history, convention, genre, form, medium, physiognomy, composition . . .) that secures he value or the significance of an object apart from one's wanting the hing to be as it is. The consequent exercise of criticism is not to determine whether the thing is good that way but why you want it that way -or rather, the problem is to show that these questions are always together. A strictness or scrupulousness of artistic desire thus comes to seem a moral and an intellectual imperative. About the latter case (of an economics of speech), I have said a word or two in The Senses of Walden (pp. 87 ft.) where I point to the vocabulary established in the opening chapter of Walden, entitled ""Economy"", as the fundamental vocabulary of the work as a whole, implying that the question of true necessaries, which it shares as its opening theme with Plato's Republic and with Rousseau's Social Contract, is a question about what we have to say as much as it is about what we have to do; and in the way Thoreau means hem, the one because of the other. My version of Thoreau's answer is in effect that he takes it upon his writing to tell all and to say nothing. - If we formulate the idea that valuing underwrites asserting as the idea that interest informs telling or talking generally, then we may say that the degree to which you talk of things, and talk in ways, that hold no interest for you, or listen to what you cannot imagine the talker's caring about, in he way he carries the care, is the degree to which you consign yourself to nonsensicality, stupify yourself. (Of course your lack of interest may be your fault, come from your own commitment to boredom.) I think of this consignment as a form not so much of dementia as of what amentia ought o mean, a form of mindlessness. It does not appear unthinkable that he bulk of an entire culture, call it the public discourse of the culture, he culture thinking aloud about itself, hence believing itself to be talking philosophy, should become ungovernably inane.

But because (or to the extent that) their work reads to us as prescientific psychology (which somebody or other has made scientific), and because we suppose ourselves to know the difference between philosophical psychology and, as it were, psychological psychology, and because of he Empiricist's desperate conclusions about knowledge, it is hard to recapture their intention, in their treatises of human knowledge, to be locating knowledge as a psychological phenomenon, as a natural human activity - so that it is likely to mean nothing to us, or to mean something obviously false, to be told that a valid belief is one that is caused in a particular way. (If the ability to make logical inferences has a psychology, it will not be discoverable by a psychologist who cannot tell the difference between valid and invalid inferences; it will not be the subject of inference which is under discussion. A comparable problem arises in the psychology, andor psychoanalysis, of art. A thinker who cannot grant the right autonomy to the object he or she is thinking about is not thinking about art.)

Later he locates this longing more fully: ""I stand between two worlds. I am at home in neither, and I suffer in consequence. You artists call me a bourgeois, and the bourgeois try to arrest me. . . . [You] ought to realize that there is a way of being an artist that goes so deep and is so much a matter of origins and destinies that no longing seems o it sweeter and more worth knowing than longing after the bliss of the commonplace.""

Tonio Kroger's remark is necessarily private from those to whom it is addressed since, as Mann's narrator puts it, "". . . their speech was not his speech"".

It may be that the violation, if survived and expiated, removes the offender from human nature upward, allows his pure spiritualization rather than his pure corporealization, or rather animalization; as presumably in the case, say, of Oedipus; allows the choosing of the other of the two natures of the human, the unique and precarious combination of which creates the problem.)",The Claim of Reason
